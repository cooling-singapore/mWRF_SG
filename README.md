# mWRF_SG Modified WRF Modelling System for Singapore

mWRF_SG is a modified WRF model under active development by the Cooling Singapore project (CS) for meso-scale urban climate simulations. For this purpose, the CS team will incorporate various extensions to original WRF code.

This repository contains the mWRF_SG code as well as any technical documentation explaining the various modifications made to the WRF code.
